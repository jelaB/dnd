# Front End code challenge for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project description

### Requirements

• Display a list of all spells \
Spells are displayed on vanilla way, without pagination which could be added, but since idea behind this coding test is
simple, functionalities are simple, and displayed data are simple, pagination is not mandatory.
Unordered list of spells contains links to "spell detail page" as list items. Click on the links within this list is the
only way for checking a details for specific spell, and consequently, the only way to put specific spell in favourites.

• Allow the user to view information related to each spell \
The idea was to use some nice style resource and add functional requirements within existing elements of the chosen
resource.\
Spell details are displayed in card styled
via [using this style](https://codeburst.io/make-a-magic-the-gathering-card-in-css-5e4e06a5e604).
Every spell card contains a "heart button" at the bottom, which is provided with the goal of adding currently displayed
spell to favourites.

• Allow the user to save spells to a list of favourites \
List of favourites is a list of 'spell cards' with full spell details. Spell could be removed from favourites only
via [favourites page](http://localhost:3000/favs).
Additionally, information about which spell is considered as favourite is also available from
the [main spell list display](http://localhost:3000/spells) where a heart icon is displayed near spell name.

### Solution discussion

There are a few places in the solution which could be discussed in terms of efficiency. The first point for discussion
is the decision to store
complete '
spell
detail' info retrieved from http://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/{index} in redux state. This decision was made because of
the visual
representation in the 'Favourites' list. Since 'cards' visualization is selected as a more 'user-friendly' option,
storing
full details was the outcome. Of course, there were a few other decisions on the table, like storing URL value for every
favourite spell and then retrieving data via API in the moment of 'Favourites' page visualization, but then it comes to
the question of what action is 'more expensive', storing details in the redux for every spell, or pinging API for every
URL,
and retrieving details as a response? In any case, since API objected here does not contain a significant amount of
data,
both solutions are supposed to be acceptable. Also, in the implementation was used redux library to reduce unnecessary
API calls, and to improve props and state propagation between components, but this also could be a place for discussion.
Card used for spell details display contain a heart button for selecting if spell is favourite or not. Since redux is
used for persistence of data, and spells are displayed from that place, it is questioned if spells stored in the regular
spell list supposed to be expanded with one more attribute as a favourite flag role, with the aim of maintaining
consistent info for related data stored on multiple places. Also, regarding test coverage, only unit tests for services
in charge of communication with API are covered, and there are other test which could be introduced.
